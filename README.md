# Important Statement
[Weight-Freezing A Regularization Approach for Fully Connected Layers with an Application in EEG Classification](https://github.com/MiaoZhengQing/WeightFreezing/edit/main/README.md) is my first work on designing a transformer specifically for EEG. The preliminary experiments for a related project have been conducted, but due to the pressing deadline of my doctoral thesis, I have had to temporarily pause this aspect of my work. After October 2023, I hope to continue researching this topic if given the opportunity (That's when I might visit the University of Vienna). 
My doctoral research focuses on the deep integration of artificial neural networks and neuroscience, advocating for the use of lightweight artificial neural network technologies to enhance EEG decoding. It is possible that my doctoral thesis and published papers may not have Chinese versions. However, there is a high-quality Chinese translation of the LMDA-Net paper available on WeChat official account (脑机接口社区), which interested readers can search for.

In the future, I hope to collaborate with internationally renowned research groups to further explore the applications of lightweight artificial neural networks in BCI. My research strengths in this field lie in the deep integration of digital signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, and neuroscience systems. I possess strong problem-solving abilities and have a solid foundation in mathematics and programming. I am comfortable working in an all-English office environment and capable of independently completing research tasks in this field. Additionally, I have previous experience in research on autonomous driving platforms, which has provided me with knowledge in areas such as computer vision and circuitry. I also possess strong teamwork skills.
If your research group is seeking to recruit a postdoctoral researcher in this field, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity for an interview. (mzq@tju.edu.cn)
